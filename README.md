## What happens in Game

```
1- Run maindrivercode.py
2- Here code is divided into files 
2.1- When we run maindrivercode.py it calls remaining files
2.2- welcome massage 
2.3- Collect the player's names
3- Until one of the player wins do the following
3.1- Roll the dice
3.2- Move the player forward for the value got on the dice roll.
3.3- If the player is on snake's head, move down to its tail
3.4- If the player is on ladder's bottom, take it to its top
3.5- else remain there and let the second player roll the dice

    print("Its a " + str(self.dice_value))
    return self.dice_value
```

```
def check_win(self, player_name, position):
    time.sleep(SLEEP_BETWEEN_ACTIONS)
    if MAX_VAL == position:
        print("\n\n\nThats it.\n\n" + player_name + " won the game.")
